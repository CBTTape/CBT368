Sam, I will send you some other code when I have time. I thought this
stuff might be helpful to some. Keep up good work

All REXX SMF stuff must be RECFM=VB instead of RECFM=VBS as REXX cannot
handle spanned records.

//*      $$$DOC   - This member                                     *   FILE 368

//*      COPYLNES - Great taking a dataset file and then create     *   FILE 368
